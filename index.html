              <h2>Part 1: What is a web page?</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
              <section id="fragments_page">
                <p>In a nutshell, it: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="fragment">is a set of files that your browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/etc) downloads and then displays on a screen  </li>
                  <li class="fragment">has a precise address that you type to the URL bar at the top of your browser</li>
                  <li class="fragment">comes from another computer (typically a server)</li>
                  <li class="fragment">is made out of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
                  (more later on these)</li>
                  <li class="fragment">can be an interactive document (like Facebook)</li>
                </ul>
              </section>

              These slides are a web page.
              <a href="http://codekitchen.mit.edu/">http://codekitchen.mit.edu/
              </a>
              is also an example of a web page
              </p>
            </section>


            <section>
              <p>Every browser gives you the ability to see the source code of
              the website. This is extremely useful for understanding and
              building websites of your own.
              </p>
              <p>
              If you are using Google Chrome on a Mac, type <code>Option+Command+U</code> to look at the web page's source code.</p>
                <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-to-read-source-code/" target="_blank">
              For other OS + browsers read here.  </a>

            <section>
              <p>Where did these files come from?
              <strong>A server!</strong>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>In the simplest terms, a server is just another computer. But
              we usually use servers for different purposes than our personal
              computers. Servers are usually connected to the internet, or are
              at least connected to a local network. They rarely have monitors
              or GUI software so they often accessed through the command line.
              </p>

              <h2>Part 2: What is a web page?</h2>
            </section> 

            <section>
              <section id="fragments_site">
                <p>Big Picture:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="fragment">one or more webpages</li>
                  <li class="fragment">(sometimes) a bunch of different web pages</li>
                  <li class="fragment">(sometimes) a server application that generates web pages on the fly (like Facebook), which would be called a web app</li>
                </ul>

            </section> 

            <section>
              <p>Let's look at a website: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Download the folder from
                  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9gzjdy7s43l9guz/AABHUfwevHGyD3loGBYFtoqTa?dl=1" target="_blank">
                    Dropbox
                  </a>
                and save it somewhere on your computer
                </li>
                <li> Open the folder with your text editor (like Sublime Text)</li>
                <li>Change few things and see the difference</li>

              </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>You have just seen the basic building blocks of a website. How cool :) Specifically you saw:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>file with <code>.html</code> extension. This file structures the content of the web page</li>
                <li>file with <code>.css</code> extension. This is a special file that stores the styling information about the website</li>
                <li>file with <code>.js</code> extension. This file adds interactions and logic</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Part 3: HTML</h2>
              <h3>(Hypertext Markup Language)</h3>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Let's look at the 
              <strong>developer console</strong>. This is similar to looking at
              the source code, except that instead of showing the original
            code that was downloaded from the server, it shows us how the
            browser sees the website <em>right at this moment</em>. The
            console is powerful.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you are using Google Chrome on a Mac, </strong>type <code>Option+Command+I</code>
            </p>
            </section>


            <section>
              <p>HTML is not really a language, it's actually a standard, a specification published by the W3C, World Wide Web Consortium. </p>
              <p>Browsers voluntarily adhere to the specification or not. Sometimes they only adhere to portions of it.</p>
            </section>

            <section> 
            <p>The W3C negotiates the specifications for the web, including HTML, CSS (<code>.css</code> file you saw in the example), and Javascript (<code>.js</code> file you saw). Browsers have to implement support for any changes to the specification.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple's Safari adhere to the vast majority of the most recent HTML specification (currently HTML5). </p>
              <p> Microsoft's Internet Explorer is notorious for ignoring the standards set by W3C.</p>
              <p> There is never 100% compliance. Many parts are hotly debated.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Wait, wait! Did you just say "HTML5"? What's that about?</h3>
              <p>HTML5 & HTML4 are just editions of the standard. Similar to International Building Code 1999 vs IBC 2001</p>
              <p>We are writing HTML5 because that is the most recent spec. There are very few differences. We aren't using any of the obscure features that browsers aren't ready to support.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Enough about standards, let's cook actual HTML!</h3>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>HTML is a tree with nodes, where each node has:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="reveal"><em>opening and closing pointy brackets</em></li> 
              </ol>

                   <p>this is what you see. It can hold other HTML tags as well</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="reveal"><code> &lta href="http://dusp.mit.edu"&gt<em>link to DUSP</em>&lt/a&gt</code></p>

              <p>There are only a small set of commonly used tags.</p>
                <pre>body div p span a

                form input
                </pre>

              <p>You can memorize most of them, but you can look them up any time. They are well documented.</p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Curious for more tags?</h3>

              CSS has a simple, consistent syntax:
                <pre>selector {
                  setting: value;
                }

              <p>
               Select via tag names
              </p>
<pre>
img {

<pre>.options {

            <section>
              <p>

              CSS can get complicated quite fast. Especially if you want a fancy layout. It is not intuitive. But colors and fonts are easy! :)
