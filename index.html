              <h2>Part 0: Preliminaries</h2>
              <p>Today we will build on the last week's workshop 
               <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bgolder/www/codekitchen/essentials/#/" target="_blank">
              Secret Coding Essentials. 
               </a>
              I'll assume that you are comfortable working with a text editor of your choice and know super basic command line commands.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>In this workshop you will be introduced to the basics of 'cooking' a delicious website. You will 'dissect' an example web site and look at its important ingredients called 
              <code>HTML & CSS</code>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              Same as before, this is a <strong>hands on</strong> workshop, so please feel free to
              pause me at any time if something is not clear.

              <h2>Part 1: What is a web page?</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
              <section id="fragments_page">
                <p>In a nutshell, it: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="fragment">is a set of files that your browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox/etc) downloads and then displays on a screen  </li>
                  <li class="fragment">has a precise address that you type to the URL bar at the top of your browser</li>
                  <li class="fragment">comes from another computer (typically a server)</li>
                  <li class="fragment">is made out of <code>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</code> (later...)</li>
                  <li class="fragment">can be an interactive document (like Facebook)</li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Let's dissect a web page. First, let's look at HTML source code.</p>

                <p>Big Picture:</p>

                  <li class="fragment">(sometimes) a bunch of different web pages</li>
                  <li class="fragment">(sometimes) a server application that generates web pages on the fly (like Facebook), which would be called a web app</li>

              <p>Let's look at the website that I pre-cooked for you. To test it out: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Download the folder from
                  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bgolder/www/WebsiteWorkshopMaterials/" target="_blank">
                    <!-- TODO:Ben!This link needs to be changed!!! -->
                    Dropbox

                and save it somewhere on your computer
                </li>
                <li>Navigate to the folder using the <strong>Command Line! </strong>Feel free to review commands

              <p>You have just seen the basic building blocks of a website. How cool :) Specifically you saw:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>file with <code>.html</code> extension. This file structures the content of the web page</li>
                <li>file with <code>.css</code> extension. This is a special file that stores the styling information about the website</li>
                <li>file with <code>.js</code> extension. This file adds interactions and logic</li>

              <h2>Part 3: HTML</h2>
              <h3>aka Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>HTML is not really a language, it's actually a standard, a specification published by the W3C, World Wide Web Consortium. </p>
              <p>Browsers voluntarily adhere to the specification or not. Sometimes they only adhere to portions of it.</p>
            </section>

            <section> 
            <p>The W3C negotiates the specifications for the web, including HTML, CSS (<code>.css</code> file you saw in the example), and Javascript (<code>.js</code> file you saw). Browsers have to implement support for any changes to the specification.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple's Safari adhere to the vast majority of the most recent HTML specification (currently HTML5). </p>
              <p> Microsoft's Internet Explorer is notorious for ignoring the standards set by W3C.</p>
              <p> There is never 100% compliance. Many parts are hotly debated.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Wait, wait! Did you just say "HTML5"? What's that about?</h3>
              <p>HTML5 & HTML4 are just editions of the standard. Similar to International Building Code 1999 vs IBC 2001</p>
              <p>We are writing HTML5 because that is the most recent spec. There are very few differences. We aren't using any of the obscure features that browsers aren't ready to support.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Enough about standards, let's cook actual HTML!</h3>
              <p>HTML is a tree with nodes</p>
              <p>Each node is made </p>
