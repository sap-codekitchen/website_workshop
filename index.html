              <h2>What is this about?</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>
A lot of coding tutorials make unspoken assumptions about what a reader already
knows. This workshop demystifies the hardest parts of getting started. 
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>
We will cover the basics of the command line, text editors, servers, data
types, and package managers. This tutorial aims to make other tutorials easier.

              <p> <span class="quote">I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. ... they
              carefully told me, computers could only do arithmetic; they could
              not do programs.</span> â€” Grace Hopper

            <section>
              <p>Code is text that is read by computers</p>
              <p>Code gives precise instructions to a computer.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Machines do exactly what you tell them to do.</p>
              <p>But when you give them instructions, you must be exact.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>This is why coding languages have rules about syntax. These
              rules are strict and they tell the computer exactly how to
              interpret the text.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>If you make one little syntax error, it might break
              everything. Coding requires patience and precision because
              computers are kind of stupid.</p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Q: How do we make precise text?</h2>
              <h2 class="magenta">A: With a 
                <a href="http://codekitchen.mit.edu/editors/">text editor</a>!</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>
              Text editors are used to make precisely composed text and they
              have a variety of features to make your life easier.
              </p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>
              For example, text editors can highlight the syntax of different coding
              languages to help you prevent errors.
              </p>

            <section>
              <p>
              Take a moment to open 
              <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ni7tz5i5laihlch/index.html?dl=1"> this file </a>
              in your text editor, to see
              syntax highlighting in action. Most tutorials assume you already
              have a text editor that you are using.
              </p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>
              <strong>To review:</strong> Code is text that contains precise
              instructions for a computer. You can use text editors to edit
              text precisely.
              </p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>To make a piece of software, it usually takes many text files
              that are carefully organized into a bunch of folders. We can
              call this collection of folders and text files the "source code"
              of a particular piece of software.
              </p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>In other words, to create software, you spend a lot of time
              carefully editing text files and making sure that they are in
              the right folders. One of the most essential unspoken skills in
              programming is careful file and folder organization.
              </p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Let's talk about file paths!</h2> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>We are going to use
              <a href="https://gist.github.com/bengolder/7997954">
              this set of examples
              </a> to guide our work with the command line.
              
              </p>
              <p> Open your command line now. Where are you? Try typing 
              <code>pwd</code>. </p> 
              <p> Can you figure out how to get to your desktop? Try using
              <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, and <code>pwd</code> to get there.</p> 
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>You should be looking at file paths. They might look
              something like this:</p>
              <pre>/Users/bgolder
~/Desktop
../Downloads
/Users/bgolder/downloads</pre>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>File paths are <strong>really important</strong>. Tons and
              tons of software is made with the assumption that certain files
              will be in certain locations, and in certain folders.</p> 
              <p>Let's talk about the difference between <strong>relative</strong> and <strong>absolute</strong> file paths.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p><strong>Absolute file paths</strong> are reliable file paths
              that point to one particular location on your computer,
              regardless of your current directory. They often start with the
              root directory (a slash <code>/</code> on Mac or Linux, or
              <code>C:\\</code> on
              Windows).
              </p>
              <pre>/Users/bgolder/Dropbox/codekitchen/workshops</pre>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p><strong>Relative file paths</strong> are defined in relation
              to your current directory. For example, if I am in 
              <code>Desktop</code>, I can use
              <code>cd ..</code> to go up one directory to my user home folder.
              then I can use 
              <code>cd Downloads</code> to go to my Downloads folder. In this
              example, they could be combined to be 
             <code>cd ../Downloads</code>, which would mean: "up one directory,
              then down into Downloads."</p>
            </section>


            <section>
              <p>Now we are going to make a script. Use your texteditor to
              make a file called 
              <code>ohyeah.sh</code> that contains only one line of text:
              </p>
              <pre>echo "Totally rad." </pre>
              <p>Save this somewhere and figure out the file path to this
              file.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>You just wrote a shell script. A rad one. Congratulations.
              Let's run it. Use the file path to run the script like this:
              </p>
              <pre>bash ../path/to/script/ohyeah.sh</pre>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Now use 
              <code>cd</code> to go to other locations on your computer,
              figure out the file path and run it using absolute or relative
              file paths.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>What if we wanted to be able to run our script from anywhere
              without having to remember the path?
              </p>
              <p>We have two choices: put it in one of several folders that
              are on <code>PATH</code>, or add its current folder to <code>PATH</code>.</p>
              <p>Let's look at <code>PATH</code>. type:</p>
              <pre>echo $PATH</pre>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>
              Let's edit <code>PATH</code>. Use your text editor to create this file (or
              open it if it already exists):
              </p>
              <pre>~/.bash_profile</pre>
              <p>If you are on Windows, you will instead need to go to Control
              Panel, then "Edit System Environmental Variables", then ask for
              assistance.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>We want to add this line to the file:
              </p>
              <pre>export PATH=$PATH:path/to/script</pre>
              <p>Now type:</p>
              <pre>source ~/.bash_profile</pre>
              <p>or start a new Terminal window. Then try running your script
              without the full file path:</p>
              <pre>bash ohyeah.sh</pre>
              <p>This should work regardless of which directory you are
              currently in.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>A few important lessons to get out of this:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><code>PATH</code> is a list of folders where commands are
                found. Everything command we use on command line is in a
                folder that is on the <code>PATH</code>.</li> 
                <li>File paths and folders are essential to making things work.</li>
                <li>You can make a shell script by just writing shell commands
                in a file and runnning it.</li>
              </ol>
            </section>


            <section>
              <h2>Part 2: The Server</h2>
              <p>You'll need your mit user name for this part.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>You've used <code>cd</code> to move around your computer. Let's use a
              command that let's us move to another computer: <code>ssh</code>.
              </p>
              <pre>ssh username@athena.dialup.mit.edu</pre>
              <p>When you enter your password, nothing will visibly change
              until you hit enter.</p>

              <p>Congratulations! You're now on the MIT athena servers. Take
              some time to explore the folder structure.
              </p>
              <p>Let's see which other servers are connected to mit:</p>
              <pre>cd /afs/
ls -la</pre>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>In the simplest terms, a server is just another computer. But
              we usually use servers for different purposes than our personal
              computers. Servers are usually connected to the internet, or are
              at least connected to a local network. They rarely have monitors
              or GUI software. You can turn your own computer into a server.</p>
              <p>We usually use <code>ssh</code> to manage and interact with servers.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>To get out of the server and back to your computer:</p>

            </section>

            <section>
              <p>Let's go look at some code. 
              <a href="https://github.com/joke2k/faker">This is a python
              library that lets you generate fake names, addresses, and filler
          text</a>.  Explore it and note that all of it is plain text files
          (written in python) that are organized into folders. In the README
          at the bottom, it says we can install it with 
          </p>
          <pre>pip install fake-factory</pre>
          <p>What does this mean?</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p>That run on command-line. Here is what it does:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>You command line looks for a script called 
                <code>pip</code> in the current directory or on your path.
                </li>
                <li>
                <a
                href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html">Pip</a>
              is a python script that downloads and installs Python libraries.
              So if you have pip installed, it will look for Python, becuase
              it needs python to run.
                </li>
                <li>Pip knows you want to install something (because you said 
                <code>install</code>). It takes the piece of text, 
                <code>fake-factory</code>, and connects to the internet.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
              <ol start="4">
                <li>Pip searches through the Python Package Index (also called
                "PyPI" or "The Cheeseshop" and finds a downloadable package
                with the name you've asked for.</li>
                <li>Pip downloads that file. Then it tries to carefully copy
                the text files into specific folders, so that Python can use
                 them.</li>
